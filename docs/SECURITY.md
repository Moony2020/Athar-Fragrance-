# Security

## Current state

Auth.js Credentials and customer-account routes are implemented through Stage
6.5 locally. Password-reset Mongo transaction/index tests and Browser reset,
token-replay, generic-response, and session-revocation checks pass on the
dedicated test database. Live Brevo delivery is not yet verified. No payment
handling is active.
Mongo access is server-only and live production credentials are not in source
control.

## Catalog data boundary

- `MONGODB_URI` and `MONGODB_DB_NAME` are server-only variables and must never use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
- Database, repository, and catalog-service modules import `server-only`, producing a build-time failure if a Client Component imports them.
- Zod validates product, variant, brand, collection, media, slug, money, and bounded public-list inputs before persistence/query use.
- Repositories construct fixed MongoDB filters from validated values; arbitrary client-provided Mongo operators are not accepted.
- Discovery accepts only allow-listed scalar URL fields; `q` is normalized and capped at 80 characters, uses literal substring matching, and never becomes a Mongo `$` operator or a regular expression.
- PDP slug input is validated before the server-only Product repository read. Its public DTO omits Mongo IDs, seed/lifecycle fields, timestamps, raw inventory quantities, and internal repository metadata. Private/missing Products remain indistinguishable to public routing; unavailable infrastructure is represented separately without a fixture fallback.
- Database errors are allowed to surface to trusted server-side callers, but connection strings are not interpolated into application errors or logs.
- `ensureCatalogIndexes()` is not a public endpoint and must be run only through a controlled deployment/migration process.
- The catalog seed is developer/operations tooling, not a route handler. Its write path rejects `NODE_ENV=production`, requires `CATALOG_SEED_ALLOW_WRITE=1`, and validates every fixture before the first write.
- Matching an existing slug is insufficient authority to overwrite it: seed records must carry the expected operational seed key. Conflicts fail rather than replacing unrelated records, and the pipeline deletes nothing.
- Stage 5.1 commerce inputs are Zod-validated and use canonical Product slug plus public Variant ID and a bounded integer quantity. The server-only commerce adapter resolves current public Product/Variant eligibility, price, and safe availability; browser-supplied prices, totals, stock, and Product records are not accepted. No Cart/Wishlist persistence, cookie, localStorage, public API, mutation, or inventory reservation exists yet.
- Stage 5.2 adds one strict Server Action for PDP Add-to-bag. Its payload permits only Product slug, public Variant ID, and bounded integer quantity; unexpected price/total fields are rejected. The `athar_guest_cart` cookie is an opaque, session-scoped identifier with `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`, and production `Secure`; it conveys no cart state or customer identity. Public canonical data is re-read for every mutation. Development/test memory storage is disabled in production, avoiding an accidental non-durable production Cart fallback.
- Stage 5.3 Cart reads never reveal raw Cart storage or cookie values. Public Cart lines are re-resolved from canonical public catalog data; stale/unavailable lines have no payable price or subtotal and may only be removed by the same opaque guest identity. Update/remove actions validate canonical Product slug, public Variant ID, and bounded quantity; Header count receives only a safe aggregate quantity.
- Stage 5.4 Wishlist entries are Product-level canonical slugs only. The `athar_guest_wishlist` cookie is opaque, httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Path=/, and Secure in production; no price, inventory, account identity, or client-owned Wishlist payload is stored. Every mutation revalidates public Product eligibility server-side.
- Stage 5.5 durable records use an opaque `CommerceOwner` (`guest | user`) and never accept owner identity from browser mutation input. Mongo `_id`, email, prices, inventory, Product copy, and subtotal are not persisted as commerce authority. Unique owner indexes, strict Zod read/write validation, optimistic revisions, TTL expiry, and production no-memory-fallback behavior were verified against dedicated non-production `athar_stage55_test`; no production database was used.
- Stage 6.4 derives authenticated commerce ownership only from the server-side
  Auth.js public `userId` session claim. Guest cookies cannot select an account;
  merge retries/concurrency are idempotent and guest state is cleared only
  after successful canonical reconciliation.

## Future baseline

- Keep secrets server-only and publish an `.env.example` without values.
- Validate untrusted input with Zod; enforce authorization server-side.
- Use secure session handling through the approved authentication design.
- Verify Stripe and PayPal webhook signatures; persist and deduplicate provider events.
- Never persist raw card data.
- Apply security headers, rate limits where appropriate, dependency review, and least-privilege access before production.

Stage 6.5 password recovery stores only SHA-256 hashes of 256-bit random
one-time tokens, expires them after 30 minutes, and atomically consumes them
with a credential password update. Forgot responses are account-independent;
reset tokens/URLs and provider credentials are never logged or returned. Brevo
credentials are server-only. Password resets increment a private credential
security version checked by Auth.js to invalidate prior JWT sessions; the
version is not part of public DTO/session data.

## Stage 6.6 integration verification status

The final Phase 6/Phase 5 regression set passed 40/40, and Browser E2E passed
8/8. Authenticated commerce ownership is selected from the server session;
public session data contains the public user ID only, not Mongo `_id`, password
hashes, or the private credential security version. Unknown/disabled account
responses remain generic. The test-mail adapter is non-production-only and the
capture endpoint requires a per-run secret. Disposable account, credential,
reset-token, Cart/Wishlist, and merge fixtures were audited and cleaned in the
dedicated test database. The preserved Owner Header/Wishlist prerender issue
is outside Stage 6.6. Live Brevo delivery remains **NOT YET VERIFIED**; live
production Atlas remains **NOT VERIFIED**.

## Stage 7.1 checkout boundary

The checkout page takes no browser-owned Cart or owner values. The server
selects the `CommerceOwner` from the Auth.js session public `userId`, or from
the existing opaque guest cookie when no session exists. It reads only stored
Cart identity/quantity, then re-resolves catalog name, active Product/Variant,
availability, current integer-minor-unit price, and currency server-side. The
public checkout projection is allow-listed and omits owner identity, Mongo
`_id`, persistence metadata, and credentials. No checkout mutation, draft,
payment credential, or new attack surface is introduced in Stage 7.1.
